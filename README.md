# Data_Structures: Data Structures are a specialized means of organizing and storing data in computers in such a way that we can perform operations on the stored data more efficiently.
Programs related to data structures in C++ from my university course.
 Following Data Structures are implemented:
* Binary Tree
* Circular Linked List 
* Prioriy Queue
* Queue
* Stack
* Hash tables
* Trees
* Heaps
Array, Queue, Linked list and stack are linear Data Structures while Trees and graphs are non linear Data Structures.
